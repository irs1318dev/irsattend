# Test Data
The test-students.csv file was created by copilot with the following prompt.

> In the tests/data folder, generate a csv file named test-students.csv. The CSV
file should have 100 rows and four columns named last_name, first_name,
grad_year, and email. The first_name column should contain first names that are
common in the USA, in south asia, and the middle east. The last_name colum
should contain last names that are common in the USA, south asia, the middle
east, and the far east. The email column should contain random email addresses
that are somewhat based on the students first and last name. Finally, the
grad_year column should contain either 2026, 2027, 2028, or 2029. Higher grad
years should be more frequent.

All names in the file are fictional. Any resemblance to actual people is
coincidental.
